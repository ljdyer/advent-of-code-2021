# Advent of Code 2021 <img src="stars.PNG">

In the words of its creator Eric Wastl:

*"<a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other."*

I discovered Advent of Code just before the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021">2021</a> installment, and decided to challenge myself to complete every puzzle and to publish the results here.

I was able to get **33** out of 50 stars on the day of release of each puzzle, and am currently working through the remaining ones.

## Notes about the table below

- Times for parts of puzzles I solved on the day of release shown in light text in the format [actual time/official time (rank)]. If the time says ??:??:??, it just means I stopped timing myself for that part but stil completed it on the same day.
- Solutions after the day of release of the puzzle are included in **bold** text in the format **[date solved (rank)]**.
- Puzzles were released at 5am GMT (midnight EST) each day. If the start time is the same as the actual time in the table below, I was awake and began working on my solution at 5am and the rank includes only others who started at the same time. If the start and actual time are different, I began working on my solution later in the day so the rank includes others who started before me.
- The links in the first column of the table link either to a readme file with a description of my solution, or directly to the finished/unfinished source code. You can also find original versions of the source code, etc. in the subfolder for each day in <a  href="/solutions">this folder</a>.
- I also recorded myself solving some of the problems and created a YouTube playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhhJfaYf4XU&list=PLqVT60R9nVJDvFUBUTh4BjA4W-IEL91gS).
