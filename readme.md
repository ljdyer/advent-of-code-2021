# Advent of Code 2021

In the words of its creator Eric Wastl:

*"<a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other."*

I discovered Advent of Code just before the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021">2021</a> installment, and decided to challenge myself to complete every solution on the day of release in the shortest time possible and to publish the results here.

## Points to note

- Puzzles are released at 5am GMT (midnight EST) each day. If the start time is the same as the actual time in the table below, I was awake and began working on my solution at 5am and the rank includes only others who started at the same time. If the start and actual time are different, I began working on my solution later in the day so the rank includes others who started before me.
- **On the day** solutions are just an upload of the unedited code file at the time I solved the problem. **Tidied up** solutions are post-edited versions of the code that show my solution more clearly.
- Click on the **YouTube** links to watch a recording of me solving the problems in real time. If the **YouTube** link is greyed out for a given day, it means I either haven't got around to uploading the video yet, or I wasn't able to record one on that day.
- An actual time of '--:--:--' means that part took me a while and I gave up timing myself, but still finished it on the day.
