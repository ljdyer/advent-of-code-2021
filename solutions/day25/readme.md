# --- Day 25: Sea Cucumber ---

## Problem statement

[here](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/25)

## Part One

I was pleasantly surprised to be able to solve this one on my own after a few days of very tough puzzles.

My [first attempt](solution-first-attempt.py) worked for the test input but took too long to complete for the actual input. My [second attempt](solution-second-attempt.py) just got too complicated and didn't work. But my [third attempt](solution-third-attempt.py) solved the problem quickly by storing only positions of east- and south-facing sea cucumbers in dictionaries without iterating over a list of lists every time.

## Part Two

Will come back to this as I need to have the other 49 stars first!
